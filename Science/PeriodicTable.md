## 1) The Periodic Table = A “Seating Plan” for Atoms

**Analogy:** Think of the Periodic Table like a **classroom seating plan**.
Atoms are “students,” and where they sit tells you their behaviour.

### What the layout means

* **Rows = Periods** (left to right)

  * **Key idea:** The period number tells you how many **electron shells** (energy levels) an atom has.
  * Example: Period 2 elements have **2 shells**.

* **Columns = Groups** (top to bottom)

  * **Key idea:** Elements in the same group have **similar properties** because they have the same number of **outer (valence) electrons**.
  * That’s why they behave similarly in reactions.

**Memory line:**
✅ **Periods = shells**
✅ **Groups = same outer electrons = similar behaviour**

---

## 2) Inside an Atom (Only what we need)

* **Nucleus** in the centre: **protons (+)** and **neutrons (0)**
* **Electrons (-)** go around in shells.

**Analogy:** Nucleus is the “sun,” electrons are “planets” in “orbits.”

---

## 3) Electron Shell Rule 

Electrons fill shells from the inside outward.

For the first 20 elements, use:

* **1st shell holds 2**
* **2nd shell holds 8**
* **3rd shell holds 8** (for Junior Cycle level)
* (Then later: 4th begins)

**Example:** Sodium (11 electrons)
2 in first shell, 8 in second, **1 in outer** → **2,8,1**

**Why outer electrons matter most:**
**Outer electrons decide bonding and reactivity** (like how many hands you have to “hold” others).

---

## 4) Groups You Must Know (and their “personality”)

Teach these as “teams” in the classroom.

### Group 1: Alkali Metals (Li, Na, K…)

* **1 outer electron**
* Very reactive (especially down the group)
* Form **+1 ions**
* **Analogy:** They are “generous” — they give away 1 electron easily.

### Group 2: Alkaline Earth Metals (Be, Mg, Ca…)

* **2 outer electrons**
* Reactive (less than Group 1)
* Form **+2 ions**
* **Analogy:** They give away 2 electrons, but not as easily as Group 1.

### Group 7 (or 17): Halogens (F, Cl, Br, I…)

* **7 outer electrons**
* Very reactive non-metals
* Form **-1 ions**
* **Analogy:** They’re “desperate for 1 more” to fill the outer shell.

### Group 0 (or 18): Noble Gases (He, Ne, Ar…)

* Outer shell full (He has 2; others have 8)
* Very unreactive
* **Analogy:** They already have a “complete set” and don’t need to bond.

**Simple rule students remember:**

* Group 1 → **makes +1**
* Group 2 → **makes +2**
* Group 7 → **makes -1**
* Group 0 → **no bonding (mostly)**

## 5) What are Ions?

An **ion** is an atom that has become **charged** by gaining or losing electrons.

* If an atom **loses electrons** → it becomes **positive** (more protons than electrons)

  * Example: Na → Na⁺
* If an atom **gains electrons** → it becomes **negative**

  * Example: Cl → Cl⁻

**Analogy:**
Electrons are like “money.”

* If you **give money away** → you feel “positive” (but you *lost* electrons!)
* If you **take money** → you become “negative” (you *gained* electrons!)

(Students often mix this up—repeat it often.)

## 6) Why Do Atoms Bond?

Atoms bond to get a **full outer shell** (more stable).

**Analogy:**
Atoms want a “full backpack” / “complete team” / “finished puzzle.”

For Junior Cycle:

* Full outer shell = **2** (first shell) or **8** (others)

---

## 7) Two Main Types of Bonding (the big idea)

### A) Ionic Bonding = Electron Transfer (Metal + Non-metal)

* **Metal gives electrons**
* **Non-metal takes electrons**
* They become ions, then **opposites attract** (+ attracts -)

**Analogy:**
Like a **donation and a grab**: one gives, one receives — then they “stick” like magnets.

**Example:** Sodium + Chlorine

* Na (2,8,1) gives 1 electron → Na⁺ (2,8)
* Cl (2,8,7) gains 1 electron → Cl⁻ (2,8,8)
* Na⁺ and Cl⁻ attract → **NaCl**

### B) Covalent Bonding = Electron Sharing (Non-metal + Non-metal)

* Atoms **share electrons** so both “feel” like they have a full outer shell.

**Analogy:**
Two students **share a textbook** — both get to use it.

**Example:** H₂O

* Oxygen needs 2 electrons to fill its outer shell.
* Each hydrogen shares 1 with oxygen.
* They share pairs → covalent bonds.

**Quick comparison**

* Ionic: **transfer**, metal + non-metal, ions form
* Covalent: **share**, non-metal + non-metal, molecules form

## 8) Chemical Formulas (Super Simple Method)

A chemical formula shows:

* **which elements**
* **how many atoms** of each

### When combining a metal and non-metal (ionic):

Use the ion charges to balance so the total charge = **0**

**Easy method: “Swap and Drop” (Cross-over)**

1. Write ions with charges
2. Swap the numbers (ignore + and - signs)
3. Simplify if needed

**Examples**

* Mg²⁺ and Cl⁻
  Swap → MgCl₂ (because need 2 chlorides to balance +2)

* Al³⁺ and O²⁻
  Swap → Al₂O₃ (2 Al gives +6, 3 O gives -6)

**Why it works:** total + charge must equal total - charge.

## A tiny “memory script” your student can repeat

**“Periods tell shells. Groups tell outer electrons.
Outer electrons decide ions and bonding.
Metals give → positive ions. Non-metals take → negative ions.
Ionic = transfer (metal + non-metal).
Covalent = share (non-metal + non-metal).
Formulas balance charges to make zero.”**
